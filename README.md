# Firebase-Assignment---Train-Scheduler

There were several issues that arose in attempting to solve this assignment, and although I was finally able to complete the assignment, unfortunately I wasn't able to have the app require user authentication. On this one! But I did eventually succeed in requiring user auth. with their gmail, or github in another firebase database, that I will be able to implement in other projects down the line..!


In this assignment, you'll create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

### Instructions

* Make sure that your app suits this basic spec:
  
  * When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
    
    * Train Name
    
    * Destination 
    
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    
    * Frequency -- in minutes
  
  * Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
  
  * Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
